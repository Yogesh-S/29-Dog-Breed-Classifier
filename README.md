# Dog-Breed-Classifier

In this notebook, we will make the first steps towards developing a dog breed classifier.  The code will accept any user-supplied image as input, if a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.  The image below displays potential sample output
